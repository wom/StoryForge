# StoryForge

StoryForge is a command-line tool that generates illustrated children's stories using AI language models. Simply provide a story prompt, and StoryForge will create both a short story and accompanying AI-generated images.

## Supported AI Backends

- **Google Gemini** - Fully supported for story and image generation
- **OpenAI** - Fully supported for story and image generation
- **Anthropic** - Supported for story (text) generation only; image generation is not currently supported

## Features

- 📖 Generate custom children's stories from simple prompts
- 🎨 Create AI illustrations with multiple art styles (chibi, realistic, cartoon, watercolor, sketch)
- ⚙️ Flexible story customization (age range, length, tone, theme, learning focus)
- 💾 Save stories and images with organized output directories
- 🖥️ Interactive terminal interface or direct CLI usage
- 📚 Context system for character consistency across stories
- ⏯️ **Checkpoint system** for resuming interrupted sessions
- 📝 **Story extension** - Continue existing stories with wrap-up or cliffhanger endings
- 🔄 **Intelligent context summarization** for efficient token usage with large context files

## Configuration

For detailed configuration options, defaults, and examples see the full configuration reference: [Configuration Documentation](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

### Generate a default config file

```bash
# Create config file in default location
storyforge config init

# Force overwrite an existing config file
storyforge config init --force

# Create config at custom location
storyforge config init --path /path/to/config.ini
```

The config file will be created at `~/.config/storyforge/storyforge.ini` by default. You can override the location using the `STORYFORGE_CONFIG` environment variable.

### Command Alias

For convenience, `sf` can be used as a shorter alias for all `storyforge` commands:

```bash
# These are equivalent
storyforge "A brave knight befriends a dragon"
sf "A brave knight befriends a dragon"

# Works with all commands
sf config init
sf continue
sf extend
sf --help
```

## Requirements

## Checkpoint System

StoryForge automatically saves your progress during story generation, allowing you to resume from any point if the process is interrupted or if you want to retry different options.

### Resume from Previous Sessions

```bash
# Resume from a previous session (interactive selection)
storyforge continue

# Or use the --continue flag with main command
storyforge main --continue
```

This will show you the last 5 sessions and let you choose:

- **For interrupted sessions**: Resume from where you left off
- **For completed sessions**: Choose to:
  - Generate new images with the same story
  - Modify and regenerate the story
  - Save the story as context for future use
  - Start completely over with the same parameters

### Checkpoint Storage

Checkpoint files are automatically stored in:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.local/share/storyforge/checkpoints/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\storyforge\storyforge\checkpoints\`

The system automatically cleans up old checkpoints, keeping the 15 most recent sessions. Stale active sessions (older than 24 hours) are automatically marked as failed/abandoned.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a story generation
storyforge "A dragon learning to dance"

# If interrupted, resume later with:
storyforge continue
# Select your session and choose where to resume
```

## Story Extension

Create continuations of previously generated stories with the `extend` command. This is perfect for creating sequels or adding new chapters to existing stories.

### Extend an Existing Story

```bash
# Interactive story selection from recent stories
storyforge extend

# The extend command will:
# 1. Show you a list of recently generated stories
# 2. Let you select which story to continue
# 3. Ask if you want to wrap up or leave a cliffhanger
# 4. Generate a continuation based on your choice
```

### Example Extend Workflow

```bash
# First, generate a story
storyforge "A brave mouse named Max finds a magic acorn"

# Later, extend it with a continuation
storyforge extend

# Output:
# Recent stories:
#   1. "A brave mouse named Max finds a magic acorn" (2025-10-26 14:30)
#   2. "Two robots become friends" (2025-10-25 10:15)
#   ...
# 
# Select story to extend [1-5]: 1
# 
# How should the continuation end?
#   1. Wrap up the story (satisfying conclusion)
#   2. Leave a cliffhanger (sets up next adventure)
# 
# Select ending type [1/2]: 2
#
# Generating continuation...
```

The extended story will:
- Continue from where the original story left off
- Maintain character consistency and story context
- Be saved in a new timestamped output directory
- Include the original story context for reference

## Installation

### Recommended: Using uv

```bash
uv tool install StoryForge
```

If you don't have uv:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Alternative: Using pipx

```bash
pipx install StoryForge
```

If you don't have pipx:

```bash
# macOS: brew install pipx
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install pipx
# Or: pip install pipx
```

## Setup

Choose one of the supported AI backends and configure the corresponding API key:

### Google Gemini

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to get your free Gemini API key
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### OpenAI

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Anthropic (Experimental)

1. Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Backend | Status | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini | ✅ Fully Supported | Required for Gemini backend |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI | ✅ Fully Supported | Required for OpenAI backend |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic | 🧪 Experimental | Required for Anthropic backend |
| `LLM_BACKEND` | All | Optional | Force specific backend (`gemini`, `openai`, `anthropic`) |

**Note**: StoryForge will automatically detect which backend to use based on available API keys. If multiple keys are set, you can specify which backend to use with the `LLM_BACKEND` environment variable.

Add environment variables to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to make them permanent:

```bash
# Example for Gemini
echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Example for OpenAI
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

### Basic Story Generation

```bash
# Generate a story from a simple prompt
storyforge "Tell me a story about a robot learning to make friends"
```

### Continue an Existing Story

```bash
# Extend a previously generated story
storyforge extend
```

### Resume a Previous Session

```bash
# Resume from an interrupted or completed session
storyforge continue
